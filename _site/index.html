  <p>Classic first post. Just a place to journal down my learnings and experiences. I was born and raised in Singapore throughout my entire life, this is my very first time leaving home to live in a foreign place. There were plenty of challenges Iâ€™ve faced the past few months, and iâ€™m sure there will be more in the upcoming year. Will be blogging here to share my experiences! Drop me an email if you have any questions / want to know more about me! :)</p>
