  <p>Happy New Year! Was watching Julie and Julia while on annual leave. It seems like a really good movie to watch for the brand new year. Julie was doing the same thing as me! Blogging about the things she like. I particularly like one quote from Julie. <br /></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">I'll probably need a deadline, otherwise it'll be like everything else I do, I never finish.</code> <br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">- Julie Powell. </code></p>

<p>Therefore this year, in order to resolve my new year resolution, I’ll try to break them down into smaller steps with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">deadline</code>.</p>

  <p>This year was a <em>really, really,</em> wild ride. So many changes took place. My own personal development, doing things that I never thought I would be able to (conquering interviews), and also, the physical change - living abroad. January, I started out really strong in exercising. I maintained running at least 4 times a week for a month, meal prepped my own lunch. However, this did not last long, as I started prepping my resume, sending them out and practice technical questions.  <br /><br /></p>

  <p>Classic first post. Just a place to journal down my learnings and experiences. I was born and raised in Singapore throughout my entire life, this is my very first time leaving home to live in a foreign place. There were plenty of challenges I’ve faced the past few months, and i’m sure there will be more in the upcoming year. Will be blogging here to share my experiences! You can use askfm to ask me a question :)</p>
