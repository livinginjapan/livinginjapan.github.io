  <p>Chapter 1, Item 5: <strong>Know what functions C++ silently write and calls.</strong> <br />
First and foremost, something that confuses the hell out of beginners / me are the C++ constructors. There are 3 different kind of constructors in C++.</p>
<ol>
  <li>default constructor</li>
  <li>copy constructor</li>
  <li>copy assignment operator.</li>
</ol>

<p>So what are the differences between those 3?</p>

  <p>Chapter 1, Item 4: <strong>Make sure that objects are initialised before used.</strong> <br />
Before I actually started reading this book / writing ANY C++ code, I created a mini project (something to keep track of my finance) to get myself started with C++. 
The closest language I know that is similar to C++ was Java. Naturally, I coded the mini project in a very Java style.  While reading the book / working / finding out more information on C++, I looked back at my project and realised I made the most fundemental mistake in C++.  Initialization and assignments are two <strong>VERY</strong> different things. (duh!)</p>

  <p>This year was a <em>really, really,</em> wild ride. So many changes took place. My own personal development, doing things that I never thought I would be able to (conquering interviews), and also, the physical change - living abroad. January, I started out really strong in exercising. I maintained running at least 4 times a week for a month, meal prepped my own lunch. However, this did not last long, as I started prepping my resume, sending them out and practice technical questions.  <br /><br /></p>

  <p>Classic first post. Just a place to journal down my learnings and experiences. I was born and raised in Singapore throughout my entire life, this is my very first time leaving home to live in a foreign place. There were plenty of challenges I’ve faced the past few months, and i’m sure there will be more in the upcoming year. Will be blogging here to share my experiences!

  <p>Chapter 1, Item 9: Never call virtual functions during construction or destruction. <br />
it will likely not do what you expected.</p>

  <p>Chapter 1, Item 8: Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors. <br /></p>

<p>C++ dosen’t prohibit destructors from emitting exceptions, but it discourages the use of it - why?</p>

  <p>Chapter 1, Item 7: Declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes. <br /></p>

<p>I’ve seen so many virtual keyword in c++ which you don’t quite see in other languages. So what is <code class="highlighter-rouge">virtual</code> ?</p>

  <p>Chapter 1, Item 6: Explicitly Disallow the User of Compiler-Generated Functions you do not want. <br />
From the previous chapter, you’ll know that C++ auto generates constructors when you don’t declare it.</p>

<p>However, what happens if you want to create unique objects? Read on to find out more.</p>

  <p>Hey all!</p>

<p>Let me introduce a new writer to this blog, M. He is a software engineer working in one of the FAANG company. 
He is also the fierce coach I mentioned in <a href="https://livinginjapan.github.io/2019-12-31/Bye-2019">previous blogpost</a>.</p>

<p>Look forward to his first post!</p>

<p>Signing off, <br />
