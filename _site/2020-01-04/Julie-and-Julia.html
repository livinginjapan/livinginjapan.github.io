        <p>Happy New Year! Was watching Julie and Julia while on annual leave. It seems like a really good movie to watch for the brand new year. Julie was doing the same thing as me! Blogging about the things she like. I particularly like one quote from Julie. <br /></p>

<code class="highlighter-rouge">- Julie Powell. </code></p>

<p>Therefore this year, in order to resolve my new year resolution, I’ll try to break them down into smaller steps with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">deadline</code>. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>My new year resolutions usually ends up pretty well, except for the fitness / lose weight part. I always keep my new year resolutions short. Approximately 3 per year. I can’t multi task at all, which gives me a little problem with the fitness part. I tend to just focus on one thing a day and feel accomplished. For example, if I were to be running diligently, I’ll not be coding diligently. But if I’m coding diligently, it means I won’t go for a run. That is a huge problem with myself and I hope to tackle that this year. <br /><br /></p>

<p>I will keep my new year resolutions for myself, but I’ll share the plans here for self-improvement. <br /></p>

<ol>
    <li> Write down whatever you do not know. Walk through the list, make a deadline to learn it. </li>
    <li> Read more. Reading is never wrong. </li>
    <li> Stay excited. (like Julia going to her le cordon bleu classes) </li>
</ol>

<p>Back to work tomorrow. Lets do this!</p>
