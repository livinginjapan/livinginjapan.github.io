Classic first post. Just a place to journal down my learnings and experiences. I was born and raised in Singapore throughout my entire life, this is my very first time leaving home to live in a foreign place. There were plenty of challenges I've faced the past few months, and i'm sure there will be more in the upcoming year. Will be blogging here to share my experiences! You can use askfm to ask me a question :)
